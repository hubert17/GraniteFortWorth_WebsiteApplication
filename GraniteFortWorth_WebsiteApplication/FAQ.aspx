<h2>How is the sales process?<a name="#1"></a></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>At DFW Wholesale Granite, we believe in taking the personal approach. Our typical sales process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit our website.</li>
<li>Review our pictures of granite choices and go to Free Quote page, send us your drawing with project information.</li>
<li>The very same day (or next day the latest) you will have project written quote (sent via e-mail, fax or mail).</li>
<li>If the quote is acceptable we encourage customers to visit our warehouse and examine the actual slabs and components that will be installed on their project <span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #333333; font-size: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">(<a href="Contact.aspx">please click here to fill out the FORM</a>).</span></li>
<li>Customer has made a final selection of granite, we will prepare a sales contract. The contract will outline the details of the project, the specifics of the project, and payment terms.</li>
<li>We will schedule an appointment to &ldquo;template&rdquo; the project. Templating is required on all projects to ensure exact measurements. The existing countertops may have to be removed at the time of templating. If the customer is installing a new sink or cooktop, the new items must be available when we create the template.</li>
<li>Fabrication - after the template is created, it is taken back to the shop where the sections are fabricated according to the template.</li>
<li>Installation &ndash; After the granite sections are fabricated, they are ready for installation. A typical installation will take between&nbsp;3 and 8 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>DFW Wholesale Granite will do everything in its power to schedule your project in such a way as to minimize the time between templating and installation. The time required can be as little as 5 days or as many as 10 days. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>What is Granite?<a name="#2"></a></h2>
<p>Granite rocks are igneous rocks also known as "fire rocks" which were formed by slowly cooling pockets of magma that were trapped beneath the earth's surface.&nbsp; Granite is the hardest of all building stones with a very close grain, making it almost impervious to stain and uniquely applicable for any interior use.&nbsp; If polished, its high-gloss finish will endure even the harshest environments.&nbsp; These characteristics are ideal for countertops and flooring making granite a reliable stone for these applications. <a href="#top">Top&nbsp;</a></p>
<h2>Does Granite stain?<a name="#3"></a></h2>
<p>For the most part, granite does not stain. While it is true that stone is a porous material, of all the stones, Granite is the least porous. A sealer is also applied to the stone when it is installed to further protect it from this possibility. Water left on a Granite countertop for a long period of time will show evidence of moisture. It will however evaporate and the "dark spot" will disappear. Oil left on a granite surface will slowly be absorbed into the stone. It is recommended that any spills be wiped up when they occur. If the spill is not caught in time and a stain does occur, a poultice may be applied to draw the oil back out of the stone. Over time the oil will naturally redistribute itself in the stone until it becomes virtually undetectable. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>How often should I seal my Granite countertops?<a name="#4"></a></h2>
<p>You can find here: <a href="http://www.stonecare.com/" target="_blank">www.StoneCare.com</a> or <a href="http://www.stonetechpro.com/" target="_blank">www.StoneTechPro.com</a> a full line of cleaning materials for your stone. The manufacturer recommends using their sealer once every six to twelve months. It is a simple wipe on, wipe off procedure that takes about the same amount of time as a general cleaning. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>Why doesn't my granite look exactly like the sample?<a name="#5"></a></h2>
<p>Our samples are generally indicative of the coloring and pattern (also known as veining) of each stone. As the Granite is quarried, differences in the stone's shading and pattern will appear. While we try to remain aware of the current tendencies of each stone, sometimes even we are caught by surprise. Since Granite is a natural material and subject to such changes, we recommend that a customer view the section prior to fabrication to ensure complete satisfaction. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>Can you re-connect my electrical and plumbing connections?<a name="#6"></a></h2>
<p>DFW Wholesale Granite is a highly trained&nbsp; contractor for granite countertops, but we are not licensed electricians or plumbers.&nbsp; Therefore, we can not assume any liability for making electrical or plumbing connections.&nbsp; We can, in most instances however, recommend reputable and licensed individuals or companies to complete these tasks for you. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>Will my granite have visible seams?<a name="#7"></a></h2>
<p>Most granite installations will require at least one or more joints called seams.&nbsp; During layout and design, DFW Wholesale Granite will always try to minimize the number of seams required.&nbsp; Additionally, the factory-machined edges fit together very tightly to help lessen the appearance of visible seams.&nbsp; <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>How scratch-resistant is Granite?<a name="#8"></a></h2>
<p>With normal daily use you will not mar the finish. Although we don't recommend it, you can even cut directly on granite without much worry of damaging the surface. Would you dare cut directly on corian or laminated surfaces? Cutting on granite will be much more damaging to your knives than it is to the granite. Unlike any other surface, granite will not lose its shine. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>Will my Granite countertop chip or crack?<a name="#9"></a></h2>
<p>Most flaws in stone are detected during transit of the slab. If it can withstand the fabrication process, it will never break under normal kitchen conditions. You would have to assault it with something like a hammer and even then, you'd have to work at it. However, granite is brittle and not flexible and will break under certain stresses. You should not drop heavy objects such a pot, large pan, vase or other heavy, hard objects onto the countertop. Although it may seem obvious, you shouldn't stand on granite countertops. Too much pressure in the wrong place can cause granite to break or crack. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>How do I care for my Granite countertop?<a name="#10"></a></h2>
<p>Soap and water works just fine, as well as mild commercial products. Do not use glass cleaners or vinegar based products. We also recommend <a href="http://www.stonecare.com/" target="_blank">www.StoneCare.com</a> or <a href="http://www.stonetechpro.com/" target="_blank">www.StoneTechPro.com</a>&nbsp;a full line of products, which includes spray cleaners, sealers, and polishes that you may wish to use occasionally. Granite is very low maintenance. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>Are there other finishes for Granite besides the high polished surface?<a name="#11"></a></h2>
<p>There are several finishes that you can have with Granite. The highly polished surface is the most popular.There is a process called "honing" that gives the stone a smooth feel but a more matte finish. You can also oil a honed finish prior to sealing to bring out more intensity in the colors. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>What is the difference between an undermount sink and a drop-in sink?<a name="#12"></a></h2>
<p>A drop-in sink sits on top of the cutout and adds small cost to your project. Those that are more cost conscious may opt for this choice. An undermount sink sits beneath the polished rim of the cutout. The benefit to this option is that it provides an attractive, smooth surface from counter to sink and makes clean-up much easier. Because there is additional polishing involved, there is an additional charge for undermount sink cutouts. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2>What is a "high-movement" stone?<a name="#13"></a></h2>
<p>Different Granites have different patterns or veining. Some stones rarely change in their tight quartz-like appearance, while others have veins that swirl and change irregularly. Since samples cannot give a good overall picture of a high-movement stone, it is wise to see the section prior to fabrication. For some, the unique pattern is intriguing and adds to the beauty of the stone. For others the effect can seem somewhat chaotic. <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
